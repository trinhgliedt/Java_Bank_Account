Create a BankAccount class. This class will recreate some of the common account transactions that normally occur for a bank account such as displaying your account number, checking and savings amount, total amount. Of course, there are also methods to invoke, such as depositing a check, checking your balance, withdrawing money.

- Objectives:

  ● Practice member variables

  ● Create a class member (static) that has the number of accounts created thus far.

  ● Create a class member (static) that tracks the total amount of money stored in every account created.

  ● Create a private method that returns a random ten digit account number.
